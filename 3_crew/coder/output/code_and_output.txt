```python
# Calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series
terms = 10000

total = 0.0

for i in range(terms):
    term = 1 / (2 * i + 1)  # Each term is of the form 1/(2i + 1)
    if i % 2 == 1:
        term = -term  # Adjust the sign based on the position
    total += term

# Multiply the total by 4
final_result = total * 4
print(final_result)
```
